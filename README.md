This repository contains my work on **Multi-Class Classification** Model building using Temporal Data.

1. **Crop Classification 2.csv** contains data I have used, which contains Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Short-wave     infrared (SWIR) remote sensing measurements for different Crops.


2. **CropClassification.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook contains: 
     - Data Preprocessing; 
     - Correlation Matrix;
     - Principal Component Analysis;
     - DecisionTreeClassifier - RandomForestClassifier - XGBClassifier ;
     - HyperParameter Tunning for RandomForestClassifier and XGBClassifier.

     => Working on this Notebook, To clarify my concepts on Dimensionality Reduction Techniques (PCA and LDA), I researched on these               topics. And, I have noted down my findings and understanding regarding these topics in **"Dimensionality Reduction - PCA &                   LDA.docx".**


3. **CropClassification LDA.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook contains :
     - Linear Desrimination Analysis;
     - Grid Search for identifying Optimum Hyperparameter for XGBClassifier.


4. **Domain Knowledge - Links.txt** file contains references I used, to understand NDVI, SWIR & Remote Sensing in Agriculture.


5. **CropClassification - Multi Layer ANN.ipynb** file contains Artificial Neural Network model built for the same dataset using KerasClassifier.

6. **TensorFlow_with_GPU.ipynb** file contains work done on Google Colab using TPOTClassifier. TPOT is a python **Automated Machine Learning** tool that optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming.

Any feedback will be appreciated.

Thanks,
Kunjan Shah.
