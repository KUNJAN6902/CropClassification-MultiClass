This repository contains my work on **Multi-Class Classification** Model building using Temporal Data.

1. **Crop Classification 2.csv** contains data I have used, which contains Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Short-wave     infrared (SWIR) remote sensing measurements for different Crops.


2. **CropClassification.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook contains: 
  - Data PreProcessing; 
  - Correlation Matrix;
  - Principal Component Analysis;
  - DecisionTreeClassifier - RandomForestClassifier - XGBClassifier ;
  - HyperParameter Tunning for RandomForestClassifier and XGBClassifier.

  => Working on this Notebook, To clarify my concepts on Dimensionality Reduction Techniques (PCA and LDA), I researched on this topic.        And, I have noted down my findings and understanding regarding this topic in **"Dimensionality Reduction - PCA & LDA.docx".**


3. **CropClassification LDA.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook contains :
  - Linear Desrimination Analysis;
  - Grid Search for identifying Optimum Hyperparameter XGBClassifier.


4. **Domain Knowledge - Links.txt** file contains references I used, to understand NDVI, SWIR, Remote Sensing in Agriculture.


I am working on rebuilding model using Artifical Neural Network.

Any feedback will be appreciated.

Thanks,
Kunjan Shah.
