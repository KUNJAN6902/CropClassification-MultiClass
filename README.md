This repository contains my work on **Multi-Class Classification** Model building using Temporal Data.

> **Crop Classification 2.csv**
Dataset I have used, which contains Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Short-wave infrared (SWIR) remote sensing measurements for different Crops.

> **CropClassification.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook contains: 
- Data PreProcessing; 
- Correlation Matrix;
- Principal Component Analysis;
- DecisionTreeClassifier - RandomForestClassifier - XGBClassifier ;
- HyperParameter Tunning for RandomForestClassifier and XGBClassifier.

=> Working on this Notebook, To clarify my concepts on Dimensionality Reduction Techniques (PCA and LDA), I underwent research on this topic. And, I have noted down my Findings and Understanding regarding this topic in **"Dimensionality Reduction - PCA & LDA.docx".**

> **CropClassification LDA.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook contains :
- Linear Desrimination Analysis;
- Grid Search for identifying Optimum Hyperparameter XGBClassifier.

> **Domain Knowledge - Links.txt** file contains references I used, to understand NDVI, SWIR, Remote Sensing in Agriculture.

I am working on rebuilding model using Artifical Neural Network.

Any feedback will be appreciated.

Thanks,
Kunjan Shah.
